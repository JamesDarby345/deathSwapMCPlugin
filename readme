This code is for a deathswap plugin for a spigot server in minecraft 1.15.2
It was written by James Darby for 3 players (works with 2) during May 2020 based on the idea
originally conceived by sethbling though he used command blocks
in game. The player, after a set amount of time swap positions in
game and try to trap kill each other. To use you need to put a jar file
of all the code, the most up to date one should be in the repository,
and put this in the plugin folder of the server. The command itself is
/deathswap player1 player2 player3 you can repeat players for only 2 player games
or for testing. It will put all players in survival and start a countdown based
on server ticks, giving a 30 sec, 10sec, and 5-1 second warning before the swap.
During the swap the players are telepoted to eachother positions and have many effects 
applied so that they cant see much, cant move much, cant take damage or lose air levels, 
to give the server a chance to load the chunks the player now occupies so the player
has a fair chance to react. /swap player1 player2 player3 will do the swap instantly
and is mostly for testing purposes.
